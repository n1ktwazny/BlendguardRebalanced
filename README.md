Hi,

The mod updates almost every important stat to make the mixed towers viable later in the game,
There are too many changes to go over every single one, but you can actually see the full list
if you dig through the code like a champ.
(or play with config files)

The main things this mod changes:
- DPS of damaging towers,
- Q generation of towers,
- HP-Regen relations,
- Fairer tower cost scaling,
- And simple difficulty scaling by making enemies faster over time

It also partially implements an alternate custom stats system, but it's not too functional.

Using the other mods in the BlenderGuardian collection (eg. Guide+ and General Fixes) is highly advised for the best experience

## Future
This mod is bad, it tries to do the impossible, literally, so after Blendguard gets an update it will 
migrate into being just a kind of "sandbox" mod + smol API.

The name will also change to something cheesy like "BlendguardUnlocked" or something like that

You will get the ability to change ALL STATS and add debug features that are currently under General Fixes via configs, 
since IDEALLY General Fixes will no longer need to be used and will be able to fade away.

There might also be a simple API thing that just exposes something like crafting to allow for changing recipes with stats via code
and in turn make something like making "a 4th tower mod" bearable. I think that'll be a good fate for this mod. Open to seeing suggestions.
