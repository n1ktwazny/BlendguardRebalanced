# Blendguard Rebalanced

Intended to be a central mod of a modpack for [Blendguard](https://romanleco.itch.io/blendguard). 
Blendguard Rebalanced was supposed to be THE mod that fixes the game's balance but instead discovered a deep rabbit hole of other issues that would've made the scope of this mod be in the ballpark of just straight up a different game. 

Right now the mod is left in a state where it's usable, but I'd reccommend not using it, if you insist, the mod is not well balanced when it comes to cost scaling.

### Roadmap
The mod tries to do the impossible, like literally, so after Blendguard gets an update it will migrate into being just a kind of "sandbox" mod + smol API thing. The name might also change to something silly like "BlendguardUnlocked" or something like that.

So post update the mod will:
- Migrate debug features from [General Fixes](https://github.com/n1ktwazny/BlendguardGeneralFixes) over to this mod.
- Add **more debug features**,
- Make all Stats edited by the mod editable via configs (Right now it's hardcoded),
- Expose the Tower stat changer as a small API thing, possibly extending it to adding custom crafting
